# fun game: find all the 👻's in the source code
# There is currently: 1 👻 (other than these 2)
# If you add a ghost please hide it well
# And don't use cmd+f/ctrl+f to find them, thats lame 👎

# TODO: (* == important)
# 	make better names && descriptions for rooms
# *	have the room descriptions tell where you can go
# 	make function that replaces stuff like east with e
# 	add some kind of plot

# AND DON'T YOU DARE USE SPACES FOR TABS IN MY CODE
